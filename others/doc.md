## FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)

Library that allows us to quickly search for multimedia documents (in our case the 128-d vectors). Weâ€™ve built nearest-neighbor search implementations for billion-scale data sets that are some 8.5x faster than the previous reported state-of-the-art, along with the fastest k-selection algorithm on the GPU known in the literature. This lets us break some records, including the first k-nearest-neighbor graph constructed on 1 billion high-dimensional vectors.
